It's almost been a year since I left the White House's Presidential Innovation Fellowship program and joined Bank of America Merrill Lynch as their Entrepreneur in Residence and thought it was time to share why. When I took this role, many friends and peers didn't fully understand the move and to be honest, I don't think I fully comprehended it either. However, as time has passed, I've been able to fully process why I sold out to corporate America.

When I joined the Presidential Innovation Fellowship, leaving both [CommonKey](https://www.commonkey.com) and [MegaBots](https://www.megabots.com), I was answering a higher cause for myself, how could I leverage my knowledge and skills to positively impact my country, the people around me, and ultimately the world.

When approached to join the Bank, I was given a similar opportunity, but in a different format. With almost 300,000 employees and close to 50 million consumer users alone, the opportunity to have an impact on the world persisted into this new role, which allowed me to build upon my previous knowledge while working in government.
