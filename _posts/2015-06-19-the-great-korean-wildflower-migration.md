A little while back I read an article published in the New York Times titled *[Why a Generation of Adoptees Is Returning to South Korea](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/18/magazine/why-a-generation-of-adoptees-is-returning-to-south-korea.html?_r=0)*. It's a story about various adopted Koreans and their choice to leave their American families, lives and friends to start anew in South Korea.

If you haven't read the article or aren't interested in dedicating an hour of your time, the abridged version is these adopted Koreans (primarily from the mid-80s) feel as if they were culturally deprived from their Korean heritage and placed in an environment where noone, including their white parents, understand the lack of racial identity. Specifically, these adopted Koreans feel as if they can't self identify with Asians born in the US and raised by Asian parents OR caucasian children who never faced the same type of inherent profiling due to skin color.

This topic is of specific interest to me because I am one of those adopted Koreans (in case the last name didn't give it away). Born outside of Seoul, picked out of a book like a Sears catalogue and shipped on a plane (BOBA > Brought Over By Airplane) at four months old, I was raised by two middle class white Americans in God's Country, Oklahoma, where I was effectively the only Asian male growing up in my community.

Don't get me wrong, I love my adopted parents and appreciate the lifestyle they provided for me. It wasn't anything special, just plain and simple middle America family house hold and values (with a little footloose lifestyle thrown in). Additionally, their story isn't too uncommon from many others who adopted children in the 80s. Married couple, unable to conceive a child (an interesting genetic delay in reproductive development in this case), looking for a way to expand their family, which led to adopting me.

It just so happens that at the same time Korea was in recovery mode from the Korean War. As the country sought to rebuild itself, adoptions began to rise due to various socioeconomic impacts. What's interesting is that families, orphanages, and the Korean government monetarily benefited from these adoptions and with legislation, became one of the easiest countries to adopt children.

What I think the article doesn't acknowledge is that these adopted Koreans are truly suffering from being a GYPSY, which is fairly well articulated in an article by the Huffington Post, *[Why Generation Y Yuppies are Unhappy](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/wait-but-why/generation-y-unhappy_b_3930620.html)*. Let's be honest here, none of the adopted Koreans referenced in the NY Times article are specifically successful in their careers. So instead of self loathing about not becoming a unique wildflower, they are able to find an alternative causation (their unconsented adoption) and take action to rectify this problem by moving back to the motherland.

It's true, I can't completely identify with Asians who were raised in Asian households, which really extends into cultural behavioral differences. At the same time, my parents and white friends will never really understand what I went through growing up in a very predominant white community and the inherent biases and racism I experienced simply based on my looks.

But you know what? I like it.

I'm able to casually traverse conversations between both groups because I can become a chameleon in an Asian crowd, learning their ways and being part of a group that most white people never get to experience. At the same time, I'm able to easily break into a white crowd talking about shotguns, meat and potatoes, and growing up in the middle of nowhere.

The conclusion? Each person must find their own path. BUT label the story as it is: GYPSY Kids Trying to Find Happiness. This doesn't simply apply to adopted Koreans, but almost everyone. It just happens to be that this group of people found it by moving half way around the world.
